/**
 * @module leadModel
 * @description This module provides a rudimentary data model for leads.
 * 
 * Currently, the leads are stored in-memory in an array. This approach is fast and 
 * simple, making it suitable for prototyping and small-scale applications. However, 
 * this method does not persist the data across server restarts, making it unsuitable 
 * for production environments or applications that require long-term data storage.
 * 
 * For production or more advanced use cases, this model should be replaced with a 
 * persistent storage mechanism, such as a database. When transitioning to a database, 
 * consider:
 * 1. Choosing a suitable database system (SQL, NoSQL, etc.)
 * 2. Designing a schema or data structure appropriate for the application.
 * 3. Implementing CRUD operations and potentially complex queries or transactions.
 * 4. Ensuring proper error handling, data validation, and security measures are in place.
 * 
 * Remember, the choice of a database should align with the specific requirements 
 * and constraints of the project.
